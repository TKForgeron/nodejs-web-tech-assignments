    "question":"In this question, we have a Dog constructor function. Our dog obviously knows the speak command. What gets logged in this example when we ask Pogo to speak?",
    "explanation":"Every time we create a new Dog instance, we set the speak property of that instance to be a function returning the string woof. Since this is being set every time we create a new Dog instance, the interpreter never has to look farther up the prototype chain to find a speak property. As a result, the speak method on Dog.prototype.speak never gets used.",
    "answer":"Woof",

    "question":"In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when this code is executed?",
    "explanation":"1 and 4 are displayed first since they are logged by simple calls to console.log() without any delay. 2 is displayed after 3 because 2 is being logged after a delay of 1000 msecs (i.e., 1 second) whereas 3 is being logged after a delay of 0 msecs. Note that, despite 3 having a delay of 0 msecs, its code will only be executed after the current call stack is cleared.",
