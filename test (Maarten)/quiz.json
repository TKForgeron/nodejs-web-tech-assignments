    "Every time we create a new Dog instance, we set the speak property of that instance to be a function returning the string woof. Since this is being set every time we create a new Dog instance, the interpreter never has to look farther up the prototype chain to find a speak property. As a result, the speak method on Dog.prototype.speak never gets used.",
