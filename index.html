            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level programming language that is often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm.
                It is the driver behind the interaction that happens on web pages, and therefore at the core of the World Wide Web (WWW).
                Since JS is the dominant client-side language of the web, most other languages that are used for web development transpile or compile to JavaScript before execution (Wikipedia contributors, 2021).</p>

                <h3>Client-Side Scripting</h3>
                <p>Client-side refers to operations that are performed by the client in a client–server relationship in a computer network (Lehtinen & Gangemi, 2006).
                    When talking about the web, we also have a client-server relationship on a network, the internet.
                    For a web page, HTML supplies document content and structure while CSS provides presentation styling.
                    In addition, client-side scripts can control browser actions associated with a web page.
                    Scripts are programs written in a simple and easy-to-use language to specify control of other programs.
                    Client-side scripts are almost always written in the Javascript language to control browsers actions.
                    The term 'front-end' is loosely synonymous for client-side web development. </p>

                <h3>Server-Side Scripting</h3>
                <p>Server-side refers to operations that are performed by the server in a client–server relationship in a computer network (Lehtinen & Gangemi, 2006).
                    JavaScript, although prevalent, can also be used for server-side scripting. Netscape's web servers were the first to support this.
                    Nowadays the Node.js framework has made its way up to the mainstream. It is not uncommon to also use JS for server-side scripting.
                    The term 'back-end' is loosely synonymous for server-side web development. </p>
